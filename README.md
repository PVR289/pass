ðŸ“Œ Complete Excel Setup for Inventory Management
1. Required Inventory to Avoid Low-Level Fee
Formula (H2) - Calculates how much inventory you need to restock to reach 28 days of supply:

excel
Copy
Edit
=MAX((C2 * 28) - B2, 0)
C2 â†’ 30-day average daily sales
B2 â†’ Current inventory
28 â†’ Target long-term days of supply
2. Inventory to Add
Formula (I2) - Since this is the same as the required inventory:

=H2
3. Low-Level Inventory Fee Per Unit (Based on Weight & Days of Supply)
Formula (G2) - Determines the low-inventory fee per unit depending on weight (J2) and supply days (E2):

excel
Copy
Edit
=IF(AND(E2<28, F2<28),
    IF(J2<=16,
        IF(E2<=14, 0.89, IF(E2<=21, 0.63, 0.32)),
        IF(J2<=48,
            IF(E2<=14, 0.97, IF(E2<=21, 0.70, 0.36)),
            IF(J2<=320,
                IF(E2<=14, 1.11, IF(E2<=21, 0.87, 0.47)),
                0
            )
        )
    ),
    0
)
J2 â†’ Product weight in oz
E2 â†’ Short-term days of supply
F2 â†’ Long-term days of supply
4. Total Low-Level Inventory Fee
Formula (I2) - Multiply fee per unit by inventory needed:

excel
Copy
Edit
=H2 * G2
5. Total Restocking Cost
Formula (J2) - Multiply restock amount by unit cost (K2):

excel
Copy
Edit
=H2 * K2
K2 â†’ Cost per unit
6. Days Until Stockout (When Youâ€™ll Run Out of Inventory)
Formula (L2) - Tells how many days you have left before inventory runs out:

excel
Copy
Edit
=B2 / C2
If value is â‰¤ 1, restock ASAP!
ðŸ“Œ Summary
H2 â†’ Units to Restock
G2 â†’ Low-Level Fee per Unit
I2 â†’ Total Low-Inventory Fee
J2 â†’ Total Restocking Cost
L2 â†’ Days Before Stock Runs Out
ðŸ‘‰ Copy these formulas into your Excel sheet, and everything will calculate automatically! ðŸš€ Let me know if you need tweaks!
